# ipk25chat-server

Test server for IPK25chat protocol. The scipt has been generated by google gemini and has some flaws, most noticibly when using UDP, that is not in strict complience with the server: When the client authenticates and receives REPLY NOK, trying to send another unsuccessfull AUTH will result into the MessageID not incrementing. Beware when testing! Other than that, there should not be any issues.
